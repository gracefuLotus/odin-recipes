        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Calzones are always a big hit for dinner time at my house. With the bubbly hot cheese
                 and spicy pepperoni, they are always good. These take a bit more prep time that I 
                like, but the taste is worth the extra effort.
            </p>
            <p>Something that is great about zones is the endless combinations you could come up with.
                The classic pizza toppings are great, but you could also try mac and cheese with
                chicken or a Thanksgiving calzone. However you decide to stuff your dinner, it's hard to go wrong
                with a calzone.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pizza Dough, 1 lb.</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella cheese, 2 cups, shredded</li>
                    <li>Pepperoni, sliced</li>
                    <li>Bananna peppers</li>
                    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set oven to 420 degrees.
                    </li>
                    <li>Seperate the dough into 3 or 4 equal balls. Take a ball and gently spread the dough flat.
                        You will need to use several different methods to acomplish this, check out my notes for
                        some different ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, layer your toppings onto the center of your flattened dough. I like to start with
                        cheese on the bottom, add pepperoni and banana peppers, then top with more cheese.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now fold your dough over the toppings so that the edges of your dough come together.
                        Press the edges firmly and twist slightly upward so that the dough sticks to itself,
                        sealing the contents inside. Cut a few slices into the top of the dough 
                        to let the air escape.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat this process with the remaining dough balls and place all the calzones onto
                        a baking sheet or baking stone.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook for 15 minutes or until the top and bottom of calzones are starting to brown.
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
