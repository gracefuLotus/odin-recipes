            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Grilled cheese is a childhood favorite of almost everyone I know.
                It is easy to make and tasty to eat. The melted cheese and crispy 
                bread pair so nicely, it could only be better with a bowl of <strong>Hot Tomato Soup</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>While any bread will do, adding something fancy here can have some pretty 
                fantastic results. I like a <em>Rosemary Olive Oil</em> bread for something 
                special. Experiment for yourself too see what would make your grilled cheese <strong><em>
                Special</em></strong>!  
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Butter or Mayo</li>
                <li>Cheese of choice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Warm a medium size pan over medium  heat.</li>
                <li>With a knife, spread butter or Mayo on one side of two 
                    pieces of bread. Place the slathered sides together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place cheese of choice on top of the pieces of bread. 
                </li>
                <li>Once the pan is warm, <em>Carefully</em> seperate the bottom 
                    slice of bread from the pile and place the other piece of 
                    bread onto the pan. Now you can place the bottom slice on top
                     of the cheese with the butter or mayo facing upward.
                </li>
                <li>Let the sandwich cook until the bottom piece of bread is toasted 
                    brown and crispy. Using a spatula, flip the sandwich over onto the pan.
                </li>
                <li>Allow the sandwich to cook another 3-4 minutes, until the second 
                    piece of bread is brown and crispy.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, remove the sandwich from the pan and turn off the heat.</li>
            </ol>
