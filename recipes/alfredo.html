        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Alfredo sauce is one of my favorite meals. The ingredients are items that stay
            good for a long time, so you can keep them around for when you need them. 
            Some nights if I do not have a plan for dinner and I need something quick, 
            alfredo saves the day.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe whips up in no time at all. When you are ready to add the pasta 
            to the water, it's time to start the sauce. Everything comes together nicely 
            in the end and it's time to <strong>eat!</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with water, leaving a few inches of space 
                    at the top. Bring water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook 
                    for 8-12 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>In a medium sauce pan over medium heat, melt together the 
                    stick of butter and bar of cream cheese. You will need to
                    stir together well and wait for all of the cream cheese to melt.
                </li>
                <li>Add milk and Parmesan cheese to the pan and stir to combine. Continue
                    to cook for a few minutes until the sauce is smooth. Add Garlic powder
                    now if you want it.
                </li>
                <li>When pasta is tender and to your liking, remove from heat and strain.</li>
